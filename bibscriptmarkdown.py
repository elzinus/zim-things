#Elzinus found this script at <https://atcoordinates.info/tag/zim-wiki/>
#And modified it for Markdown use
#Created original by: Frank Donnellyâ€™s 

#Parse notes stored in zim wiki to extract all bibtex records and write them
#to a new bibtex file named under value 'outfile'.
 
# === FILEFORMAT ===
#Script must be stored directly above the notes folder where the data files
#are stored. It will ignore the empty bibtex template files and will only
#read wiki files stored as .markdown. (if you use other formats change both
#instances of .mardown).

# === TAGING OF BIB INFORMATION IN YOUR FILES ===
#The script reads each line and ignores them until it finds the open
#tag. Then it starts writing each line until it reads the close  tag.
#A line return is appended so records are separated in the output file.

#Within the markdown document, all bibtex records in the notes you want to in-
#clude need to be enclosed in a bibtex TAG. In this script I use '<bibtex> 
#but you can change this easy according to your whishes.


#A list and count of extracted records is provided as a diagnostic

#Change outfile if you want to use another name for your .bib file
#outfile='sources_'+str(now)+'.bib'
